# Spectator Trigger Datapack for Minecraft v1.0

**Currently working for 1.19.3 (pack format 10).**

This datapack adds a trigger (/trigger s) for toggling between spectator and survival mode.
The intended purpose is to assist with building/redstoning when not all players have OP.
There is a 5 second delay between typing the command and changing gamemode to prevent abuse.
